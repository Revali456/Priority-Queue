# Priority Queue Implementation

## Overview

This C++ header file `prqueue.h` provides a custom implementation of a priority queue using binary search. It allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements based on priority values. The queue maintains elements in ascending order of priority, ensuring that the element with the lowest priority is always at the front of the queue.
